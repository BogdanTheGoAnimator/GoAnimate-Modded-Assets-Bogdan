Since you downloaded this character creator asset pack, let me show you how to install it.

Simple! Drag both the "family" and "cc2" folders into the following path: [your Wrapper: Offline folder]/server/store/3a981f5cb2739137/cc_store
If prompted to replace the files, click "Replace files in destination".

Optionally, if you want any of the disabled assets to be enabled, just go into your text editor, find an asset thay you want enabled and replace "enable="N"" with "enable="Y"" in a cc.theme.xml file depending on your liking, but you can enable them all by using the ctrl+H shortcut, but I recommend you leave those XML files unedited so you get all the assets that are found necessary.

Also, I deleted most of those assets I ripped and stole from FlashThemes, like the ones Mark made, because I had an argument with him about sharing his private assets, which was considered to be a form of piracy, but thankfully I admitted so, apologised to him and deleted those stolen assets.

Any questions, queries or concerns? Any missing parts or assets? Any errors in those assets?
Let me know in my Discord DMs at jackp2006 or JackTheGoAnimator2006#3431
